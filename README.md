# Personal Finance Suggestions

This is a collection of financial suggestions I've come up with. It's intended to be a best effort I've come up with reading what I have and my personal experiences. It's not a complete guide, or anything like that. Please look up and use other resources, I try to link several along the way; I'm not that smart, trust people smarter than me.

	* This is where a lot of this information grew from (including the flow chart), and how to continue investigation as well, these people know far more than I do

Just to be clear I'm not a financial planner or a fiduciary, and these are just suggestions I've come up with by doing research online and my own personal life experience.

## Stay Alive

Start using budget management software like [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/) or [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/).

Pay the basics: rent, food, utilities, toiletries, things needed for work, health care, and minimum payments on everything already owed

Budget, Reduce Expenses, Set Realistic Goals

## Put 1k In The Bank

This is the start of your [emergency fund](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds) and should come right after paying your bills that keep you alive.

This (an emergency fund) needs to be liquid: it should be checking or savings, **NOT** CDs, ETFs, 401k, etc.

## Core Focus

Use budget management software mentioned in [Stay Alive](#stay-alive)

Don't try to make too drastic changes, changing lifestyle is hard, it's better to be realistic and stick to it than to set lofty goals that you won't be able to stick too.

### Track It

You can't improve what you don't measure. To fix anything you have to keep track of it. For your first budget don't limit, just measure. Just see where you are at now. You will find things you want to fix, but as said before be reasonable about them. You aren't going to cut everything out day one, and even when you reach where your goals

## Employer Matching

If your employer is matching any money (usually 401k, HSA, other benefits), then you be getting that first off. In most cases it's a 50-100% gain which is "better" than nearly any legal loan is "bad" -- **DON'T LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE**.

If your employer offers any kind of match, you should PROBABLY take as much money as they offer.

## Debt Consolidation

**PERSONAL NOTE:** As guideline you should only consolidate debt when it either: brings the payment into an amount you can reasonably pay per month, or reduces the rate of interest of the debt. The first condition is baseline, you need it, but you should cut everything else you can to make that; the second condition is what to consider when you are consolidating to payoff debt when not in tight straights; the exception to both of these is psychological payoff, picking something means nothing if you can't stick to it. **THIS IS THE SNOWBALL vs AVALANCHE METHOD C. Basically paying off small things vs large things, paying off high interest vs consolidation, and general prioritization in referenceThgese cdecisions are very personal and are at the apexthe cross section of  utility. HOICE**

This choice is an optimization choice that involves three primary factors: what you can afford, interest rate, and personal psychology. You need to be able to afford your choice, you should pick as low of an interest rate as possible, and you need to maximize your psychological payoff for following your plan.

## Debt Payoff

Paying off debt has a few strategies as mentioned in [debt consolidation](#debt-consolidation). Basically paying off small things vs large things, paying off high interest vs consolidation, and general prioritization in reference utility. These decisions are very personal and are at the cross section of 

### High Interest vs Low Interest

If it's high interest (>= 10%) debt you want to pay that off as soon as possible after employer matches.

If it's low interest (<= 5%) debt you want to pay that off when it makes you happy, minimum payments make sense if you are working on maxing out your 401k/Roth/HSA/etc.

Medium interest (10% > x > 5%) is harder to determine what is the strategy and basically comes down to math. If you don't want to do the math, reduce risk and pay off debt.
